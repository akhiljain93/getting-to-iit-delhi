# Bus


The most obvious and visible mode of transportation that most Delhiites are familiar with are DTC Buses. With a fleet of over 3000 buses traversing more than 700 different routes, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) holds one of the largest CNG-powered bus fleets in the world. Bus routes connect between almost every corner of the city at frequent time intervals. There are kinds of buses available --  
1. DTC TATA Non-AC buses  
2. DTC TATA AC buses  
3. DTC Traditional buses

Although we have tried our best to form an exhaustive list of bus-routes, the best thing to do when planning to travel by bus is to ask away! Ask any person nearby who you think might know the answer -- Paan walas, Chaat walas, office-goers and students are especially well-versed with bus-routes (not kidding!). At the end of the day, however, travelling by bus is not the most comfortable journey you can make -- most buses are extremely crowded during peak hours, and it is difficult to stand, let alone carry luggage, in such a situation.

You must note that for every bus number, there are two routes. For example, bus number 764 goes from Nehru Place to Najafgarh, and also from Najafgarh to Nehru Place. You must board the bus going in the right direction. Just like in the Metro, there are seats reserved for senior citizens, the physically challenged and ladies.

**Our suggestion**: Although very cheap, most buses are still too crowded. AVOID at all costs, on your first trip to Delhi!
