Tell-you-what!
If arriving at a non-peak hour (see section on Metro), you should preferably take the Metro. You can also use the Metro during peak traffic hours, but be prepared for some dhakka-mukki. There is a metro station right at the bus station, and should be your ideal choice! Hop on at Kashmere Gate (on the Yellow Line itself) and hop off at Hauz Khas (see section on Metro).Â If unsure, you can always take an auto/taxi.
