## From Delhi Junction / Old Delhi Railway Station (DLI)

 - **Nearest metro station** - Chandni Chowk
 - **Nearest bus terminal** - ISBT Kashmere Gate
 - **Autos/taxis** - Easily available outside

**Tell-you-what!**
If arriving at a non-peak hour, you should preferably [take the Metro](#metro). You can also use the Metro during peak traffic hours, but be prepared for some dhakka-mukki. Chandni Chowk metro station is at a walking distance from DLI, and should be the ideal way! Hop on at Chandni Chowk (on the Yellow Line itself) and hop off at Hauz Khas ([see section on Metro](#metro)). If unsure, you can always take an auto/taxi.
