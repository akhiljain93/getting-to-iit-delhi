Tell-you-what!
The Station and the ISBT are at a walking distance from each other. While the Nizamuddin Station is only about 12-13 km from IIT, same as NDLS, the connecting public transport is poor, with no metro line at the station. Therefore, if possible, avoid travelling by a train which arrives at HZNS or a bus that arrives at Sarai Kale Khan. If you have already booked your tickets or cannot avoid the station, it is best to take a direct Auto/Taxi to IIT. There is no direct bus to IIT from ISBT Sarai Kale Khan.
