# Taxi

A very convenient, though not-so pocket-friendly way of commuting from anywhere to anywhere is to catch a taxi, although they can be a bit harder to find than, say, a Metro station or a Bus stand. However, if coming from any of the Railway Stations/Airports, there are plenty of taxis available for hire. You will almost always find a pre-paid Taxi counter at the station/airport(s) exit. You may also hire Radio Taxis who are readily available -- a simple call away. Google "Radio taxis in Delhi" for more info.

**Our suggestion**: Unless you have a LOT of luggage (including parents' luggage), prefer the Metro/Auto over this. The prices can easily run above Rs. 300 per ride. If the high price is not a factor, then this can be your most comfortable option.
